# C Language Lexer

The program identifies and classifies different types of lexemes, including keywords, identifiers, constants, literals, operators, and punctuations. Once identified, it generates a report showing the list of tokens found. The goal is to provide a useful tool for understanding the structure and content of source code, facilitating subsequent steps such as syntax and semantic analysis.
